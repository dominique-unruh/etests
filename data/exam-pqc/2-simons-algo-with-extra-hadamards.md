# Simon's algorithm with extra Hadamards

Recall Simon's algorithm for finding a XOR-period of the function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$. As its main step, it executes the following quantum circuit (multiple times):

[TODO PICTURE]

We have introduced gaps in the picture, depicted as numbered circles 1â€“5. In which of these gaps can we insert $H^{\otimes n}$ or $H^{\otimes m}$, respectively, so that the algorithm still works correctly? (I.e., so that Simon's algorithm will find a period if there is one when using the circuit with added Hadamard gates.)

Yes means you can introduce a Hadamard, no means you cannot.
